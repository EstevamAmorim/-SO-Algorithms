# Disk Arm Algorihm
## Algorithms
FCFS (First Come First Served)
SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
Elevator

## Input
The input is a sequence of numbers, the first is the number of cylinders on the disk, the second is the cylinder where the arm is initially positioned and the rest are access requests.

## Output 
For each algorithm, the total number of cylinders traveled is shown.
